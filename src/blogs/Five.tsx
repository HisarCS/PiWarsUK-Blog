                <h1>Re-re-re-re Designing of Our Motor Holders</h1>
                <p>Back to the drawing board again! We're looking at our motor holders and trying to figure out how to make them better. It's a bit frustrating at times, but we know that every mistake brings us closer to success. We're determined to get it right, no matter how many tries it takes.</p>

                <p>Prototype: This prototype had some strength issues where it always got broken from the part where it was connected to the motor so we had to improve our design by making the problematic part ticker. When it was time to attach them to the chassis, we realized that we forgot to make the screw holes that were connecting the holder to our chassis in the metric 5 size.</p>

                <p>The latest product: Here is the latest design and this is what we will be using in our final robot. We   added the required holes, made the structure stronger and did not forget to add our name to our design :)</p>
