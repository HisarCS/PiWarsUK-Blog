                <p>Hey there! Welcome to HisarCS, our awesome robotics team! We're a bunch of friends who share a love for technology and robots, coming from the IdeaLab in the Hisar School in Istanbul/Turkey. From coding to building, we've got a bit of everything in our group. As we gear up for PiWars, our mentor Sedat Yalçın and we, the team members, Poyraz Özzengi, Kami Topalyan, Melis Peker, Beliz Kasacı, Derin Ökten, are excited and can’t wait to share our journey with you. Get ready for some fun and challenges ahead!</p>
