                <h1>The Cover of Our Robot</h1>
                <p>The cover of our robot was an important thing that we had to focus on. First, we discussed some ideas and as we had to make our robot look disastrous or  "responses to disaster", we decided on designing a robot which looks like a futuristic pick-up truck responding to a disaster and some of our friends even called this design a competitor against the Tesla Cyber-Truck.</p>
                <p>The Design: We were not planning to add windows to our design and make our cover fully 3D printed, but later we saw that this was not eco-friendly toward nature as it was using the double amount of filament that is used when the cover was printed with the windows and also the plexiglass windows made our design look cooler along with showing what our electrical board looks like.</p>

                <p>A minor problem: The only problem we had was attaching our cover to the chassis. At first, I was planning to do it by creating a slide-in mechanism that was going to fit perfectly and hold the cover together. Later, when the printing was done and it was the time for attaching the cover we realized that the mechanism was not strong enough to hold the cover as it was 3D printed so we went with using bolts to attach the cover.</p>
