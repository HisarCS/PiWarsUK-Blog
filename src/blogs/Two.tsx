                <h1>Design Brainstorming</h1>
                <p>We gathered around our computers, deep in thought about our robot's design. We're scribbling ideas, chatting, and sipping on coffee. Every click of the mouse brings us closer to bringing our robot to life. It's a mix of excitement and brainstorming as we figure out how to make our robot the best it can be. First, we exchanged different ideas with each other and decided on making our robot go by 4 wheels on the bottom as we had to complete an obstacle course. Speaking of the obstacle course, we did not forget to design our robot considering the different challenges and planned to create various attachments about them.</p>
